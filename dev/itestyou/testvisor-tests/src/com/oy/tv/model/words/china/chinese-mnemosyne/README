These files are for use with the mnemosyne software 
(http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/). You will need simplified 
Chinese fonts (or traditional for the traditional version), though
a unicode font is recommended because of the 
pinyin tone marks, which are not properly implemented in all GB fonts.

hsk-chinese.xml        -- Characters and words from the HSK set
top-chinese-characters -- Most frequent 2000 Chinese characters

hsk-chinese-(traditional).xml -- The traditional character version
                                 of the HSK database

The HSK is the standardised Chinese proficiency test and the characters 
in the HSK tables are both needed to pass the test and considered 
important by the Chinese government. It is a common way to gauge progress.
Learning the most frequent characters first is obviously also a good 
supplemental strategy.



NOTE:
Mnemosyne currently doesn't support items belonging to multiple categories. 
Since there is considerable overlap between the two sets, they are separated. 
You can import both of them into your database, but the order in which you 
import them determines which categories in your database will be incomplete. 
For example, if you load the hsk database first, then your most frequent 
character categories will only contain the characters which are not contained 
in any of the other categories.
