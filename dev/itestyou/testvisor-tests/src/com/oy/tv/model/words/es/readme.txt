	File Created by Dave K.
	Source: 1001 Most Useful Spanish Words by Seymour Resnik

	Description: File contains only the Spanish Questions with English answers.  You may of
	course create your own vise-versa cards when you are comfortable enough to go in that direction. 

	The book's title apparently is meant to be catchy and does not reflect the actual number of words, which amount to 1312 in all.  

	The majority of the words are uncategorized.  I included sentences for words whose meaning 
	was difficult (at least for me) to grasp without context, ex.
	------------------------------------------------
	Question:
	repente, de

	Answer:
	suddenly

	De repente apareció el niño.
	Suddenly, the child appeared.
	-------------------------------------------------

	I also include sentences for many reflexive verbs (casarse, despartarse, etc.) to show how they are used in context.

	The latter part of the book (5 out of 55 pages) includes the following groups which I have created as 
	categories, omitting "numbers."

	animales - Animals
	colores - colors
	comida - food
	la familia - family
	los días de la semana - days of the week
	los meses del año - months of the year
	profesiones - professions
	tiendas - shops/stores
	las estaciones - seasons

	Reasons to buy the book even though you have this file:

	- It sells for $2.00, brand new.
	- It's small and portable.
	- It contains sentences for all of the uncategorized words (which is the majority of them), and tips on 
	learning vocabulary.
	- I cannot guarantee this file does not contain typos or misspellings.

	Enjoy!
