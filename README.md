Now obsolete, **ITestYou.com** is an adaptive education platform for Math, English Vocabulary, Foreign Languages and other subjects. Whether you are already A+ student or just want to become one – practicing online with us is more fun than ever!

It was started in 2005 when my younger son was just 10. I was frusturated by xeroxed math worksheets in his school and developed ITestYou to help him study.

Now in 2018, I am shutting it down as Khan Academy and IXL.com fulfilled the vision.
